# Welcome to my portfolio
You are here either because I sent you a link to have a look at what I am capable of, or you just happened to stumble upon my profile. Take a look at my projects. If you want any extended details on how the code works, ask me on Discord.

Alot of the files have self explanatory names, this readme is just a general guide.

## My first projects: Datastores and data logic.
My datastores are easily scalable and are designed to be that way, generally. I like adding leaderstat logic with my datastores, but if your development team has already handled leaderstats, that is not an issue, as leaderstats are easily accessible from anywhere as they are a child of the player.

# BasicDatastore.luau
A basic datastore logic system that is not designed for handling large playerbases, but is extremely effective at handling small playerbases. Loads playerdata on join, saves it on leave. The event.OnServerEvent function is just there to prove my capabilities of client-server communication, especially in a datastore environment.
